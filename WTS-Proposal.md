Generations Working to Facility ‘Watch The Screens’, A Pilot Project of the Watch the Skies®  Gameplay
#### Work in progress - [Github repo: Watch The Skies](https://github.com/EwRicklefs/Watch-the-screens)

## References
[**"Watch the Video"** for _Watch The Skies®!_](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/tag/watch-the-skies/) a 70-person MegaGame pitting teams of players against one another as the nations of Earth… or as an extraterrestrial menace! ... If you want to play with just one friend, Corporations and Media are for teams-of-two.

## Use Case(s): 

There are three (3) users at this time to be accounted whose narrative behind each is as follows: 
- as a user, I navigate to the app upon entering a room.  The app displays the remaining time left in the current round to play, the articles in the current news briefing, and the headlines of all of the articles displayed in scrollbar.  
- as a reporter, I want to write up a current news story and a form will populate which will be reflected in a modal to ensure the verbiage is what I want; I then click 'submit' and it will display. 
- as an admin, I want to be able to create a new game, read whatever is in play at this time, update the current round time so as to keep the current game in play, and end a game as necessary. 
## Database 
Schema of the data:
[Watch The Screens - Database Schema]("https://dbdiagram.io/d/5cafb8d4f7c5bb70c72f9a8f") 

## Software architecture overview
The user interface of this application shall be a single page application based on Bootstrap and handlebars.


## Definitions

- **Goal:** An easily accessible widely available offering live updates on news in realtime in order to keep earth safe and peaceful.  

- Goal statements are generally consistent with the strategies of the actual Watch the Skies game.  All gameplay refs will be presented adhoc by the Admin (ie.‘used distributed throughout the United Nations Progress Reporting System in case of an alien invasion’ ). 

- Sockets will create numbers of listeners
- client and server side; find the listeners first server side (ie built like routes, define listeners, route them: pkg of server side and one client side pkg of socket.ios.  

- Server side: one installed, Client side: one included

- We need rooms: Admin registers one room: entire application; Each of individual player instances are one room allocated to one game, at present	

- able to have all room	Server side lists available, active, rooms for user to be able to update in current state socket.io: the instance of the rooms/channels created in the game;								
- Set-up to outreach goals: have players all over the world (Tutorials available for socket.io: create rooms, channels, multi-player feature, etc. ensure we have the applicable io for our app.  						

- Another library/webpack is to be used similar to js.marquee.		
## CRU(D)
- **Game Player: User-** Read only privilages
- **Game Player: Reporter-** create() articles of news stories; read();
- **Game Player: Admin-** create() articles of news stories; read(); updates though changes things adhoc; reset time; adding increments, 
    -    ie. new val(); start new round;			
						
- **Tactic:** In order to trigger the best and isolated outcome of the given event, targeted codign will be instituted as needed for the given persons playing the game.					
						
- **Activity:** A specific action step related to the tactic given, is the addition of event listeners.						
						
- **Benchmark:**  Synchronizing data and allow people to access  live data as it occurs. 

- **Games state/News state aggregators:** The amount of time left in the rounds will dictate for the users to have the amount of time dictating the news reel, presented and auto refreshed to the rooms: 
   - display this info to room full of games in real time.  This will enable the participants to know what is going on in real time. 
    - This application is the "jumbotron" at a given live game functioning as it's display/scoreboard.  						
						
## Need Fulfillments & Strategies						
- Preparation: Tactics that provide the groundwork and enable partnerships to work toward interstellar political partnership building/maintenance, assessment, generating resources, strategic planning, community visioning (ie.UN).	
						
- Promotion: Tactics intended to educate the public, media and policy-makers and increase the presence of active living messages and cues to action.												
- Programs: Organized efforts to encourage and provide greater opportunities for interpersonal dissemination of information between Players/Users/Admins aka Countries/Facilitators/Reporters	
    - Examples include gaming parameters. ie. Article names, etc.  									
- Policy: Tactics intended to influence changes in public policies and standards as well as organizational practices. Examples include advocacy, relationship building with policy-makers, presentations to policy boards, influencing interstellar policies, working with intergalactic species to maintain intergalactic order.
